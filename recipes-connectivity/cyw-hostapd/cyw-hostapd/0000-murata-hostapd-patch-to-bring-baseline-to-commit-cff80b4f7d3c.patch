+# hostapd depends on strong random number generation being available from the
+# operating system. os_get_random() function is used to fetch random data when
+# needed, e.g., for key generation. On Linux and BSD systems, this works by
+# reading /dev/urandom. It should be noted that the OS entropy pool needs to be
+# properly initialized before hostapd is started. This is important especially
+# on embedded devices that do not have a hardware random number generator and
+# may by default start up with minimal entropy available for random number
+# generation.
+#
+# As a safety net, hostapd is by default trying to internally collect
+# additional entropy for generating random data to mix in with the data
+# fetched from the OS. This by itself is not considered to be very strong, but
+# it may help in cases where the system pool is not initialized properly.
+# However, it is very strongly recommended that the system pool is initialized
+# with enough entropy either by using hardware assisted random number
+# generator or by storing state over device reboots.
+#
+# hostapd can be configured to maintain its own entropy store over restarts to
+# enhance random number generation. This is not perfect, but it is much more
+# secure than using the same sequence of random numbers after every reboot.
+# This can be enabled with -e<entropy file> command line option. The specified
+# file needs to be readable and writable by hostapd.
+#
+# If the os_get_random() is known to provide strong random data (e.g., on
+# Linux/BSD, the board in question is known to have reliable source of random
+# data from /dev/urandom), the internal hostapd random pool can be disabled.
+# This will save some in binary size and CPU use. However, this should only be
+# considered for builds that are known to be used on devices that meet the
+# requirements described above.
